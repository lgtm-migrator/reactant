# Pluggable

`Pluggable` is an important concept of Reactant. It provides an interface that allows you to encapsulate many of React's libraries in a clean design. You can base complex plugins on it to encapsulate them simply enough.

## API

* [Pluggable](../api/reactant-module/classes/core_plugin.PluginModule.md)

## Example

* [reactant-router](https://github.com/unadlib/reactant/blob/master/packages/reactant-router/)
* [reactant-storage](https://github.com/unadlib/reactant/blob/master/packages/reactant-storage/)

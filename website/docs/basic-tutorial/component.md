# React Component

Reactant advocates separation of concern, so we recommend that components should have as little business logic as possible and make the [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) as pure as possible; we also advocate using Function components and using a [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) whenever possible.

In Reactant's View Module, React components can also be injected by the original dependency module, depending on your abstract understanding of the current View Module.
